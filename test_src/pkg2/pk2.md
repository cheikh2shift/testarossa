## Code Sharing Explanation: `pkg2` and `pkg1`

This document explains the interaction between `pkg2` and `pkg1` in the provided Go project, focusing on how `pkg2` utilizes the structure defined in `pkg1`.

**`pkg1`:**

*   **File:** `../test_src/pkg1/pkg1.go`
*   **Purpose:** Defines a simple data structure, `Tracker`.
*   **Content:**

    ```go
    package pkg1

    type Tracker struct {
    	Walks int
    	Naps  int
    }
    ```

    *   The `Tracker` struct has two integer fields: `Walks` and `Naps`. This struct represents a way to track the number of walks and naps an entity has taken.  The `Naps` field is currently unused by `pkg2`, but could be extended in future.

**`pkg2`:**

*   **File:** `../test_src/pkg2/pk2.go`
*   **Purpose:** Provides functions for generating slices of `Tracker` structs.  It imports and leverages the `Tracker` type defined in `pkg1`.
*   **Content:**

    ```go
    package pkg2

    import "github.com/cheikh2shift/testarossa/test_src/pkg1"

    func GenTestWalks(count int) []pkg1.Tracker {

    	result := []pkg1.Tracker{}

    	for i := 0; i <= count; i++ {
    		result = append(result, pkg1.Tracker{
    			Walks: i + 2,
    		})
    	}

    	return result
    }

    func GenTestWalksInverted(count int) []pkg1.Tracker {

    	result := []pkg1.Tracker{}

    	for i := 0; i <= count; i++ {
    		result = append(result, pkg1.Tracker{
    			Walks: i - 2,
    		})
    	}

    	return result
    }
    ```

    *   **`import "github.com/cheikh2shift/testarossa/test_src/pkg1"`:**  This line is crucial.  It's how `pkg2` gains access to the `Tracker` type defined in `pkg1`.  Without this import, `pkg2` would not be able to use `pkg1.Tracker`.  It specifies the import path to `pkg1`.
    *   **`GenTestWalks(count int) []pkg1.Tracker`:** This function generates a slice of `Tracker` structs.
        *   It takes an integer `count` as input.
        *   It initializes an empty slice `result` of type `[]pkg1.Tracker`.
        *   It iterates from `i = 0` to `count` (inclusive).
        *   In each iteration, it creates a new `Tracker` struct, setting the `Walks` field to `i + 2`, and appending the new struct to the `result` slice. The `Naps` field is implicitly initialized to 0.
        *   Finally, it returns the `result` slice.
    *   **`GenTestWalksInverted(count int) []pkg1.Tracker`:**  Similar to `GenTestWalks`, but this function generates a slice where the `Walks` field is set to `i - 2`.

**Summary of Interaction:**

`pkg2` *depends* on `pkg1`.  It reuses the `Tracker` data structure defined in `pkg1` to create collections of `Tracker` instances.  This promotes code reuse and allows `pkg2` to focus on the logic of generating the `Tracker` data without having to redefine the structure itself.  The `import` statement is the key mechanism that enables this sharing.

**Testing:**

The `pk2_test.go` file provides unit tests for the functions in `pk2.go`, further demonstrating the usage and correct functionality of the shared `Tracker` type.
