## Code Documentation: Package `pkg2`

This document describes the functionality of the `pkg2` package, which provides functions to generate slices of `Tracker` structs defined in `pkg1`.

**Package Import:**

```go
import "github.com/cheikh2shift/testarossa/test_src/pkg1"
```

This line imports the `pkg1` package.  This is necessary because `pkg2` uses the `Tracker` struct defined in `pkg1`. The `Tracker` struct likely has fields related to tracking walks and naps.

**Function: `GenTestWalks`**

```go
func GenTestWalks(count int) []pkg1.Tracker {

	result := []pkg1.Tracker{}

	for i := 0; i <= count; i++ {
		result = append(result, pkg1.Tracker{
			Walks: i + 2,
		})
	}

	return result
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This function generates a slice of `Tracker` structs, each initialized with a `Walks` value based on an increasing sequence.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `count` (int):  Determines the number of `Tracker` structs to generate in the slice. The slice will have `count + 1` elements.
*   **Return Value:**
    *   `[]pkg1.Tracker`: A slice of `Tracker` structs. Each `Tracker`'s `Walks` field is assigned a value starting from 2, incrementing by 1 for each subsequent element in the slice.  Other fields like `Naps` will be their zero value (likely 0).
*   **Logic:**
    1.  It initializes an empty slice named `result` of type `[]pkg1.Tracker`.
    2.  It iterates from `i = 0` to `i <= count`.
    3.  Inside the loop, it creates a new `Tracker` struct. The `Walks` field of this struct is set to `i + 2`.
    4.  The newly created `Tracker` struct is appended to the `result` slice.
    5.  Finally, the function returns the `result` slice containing the generated `Tracker` structs.

**Example:**

If `count` is 2, the function will return a slice containing the following `Tracker` structs:

*   `Tracker{Walks: 2}` (when i = 0)
*   `Tracker{Walks: 3}` (when i = 1)
*   `Tracker{Walks: 4}` (when i = 2)

**Function: `GenTestWalksInverted`**

```go
func GenTestWalksInverted(count int) []pkg1.Tracker {

	result := []pkg1.Tracker{}

	for i := 0; i <= count; i++ {
		result = append(result, pkg1.Tracker{
			Walks: i - 2,
		})
	}

	return result
}
```

*   **Purpose:** This function generates a slice of `Tracker` structs, each initialized with a `Walks` value based on a decreasing sequence.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `count` (int): Determines the number of `Tracker` structs to generate in the slice. The slice will have `count + 1` elements.
*   **Return Value:**
    *   `[]pkg1.Tracker`: A slice of `Tracker` structs. Each `Tracker`'s `Walks` field is assigned a value starting from -2, incrementing by 1 for each subsequent element in the slice. Other fields like `Naps` will be their zero value (likely 0).
*   **Logic:**
    1.  It initializes an empty slice named `result` of type `[]pkg1.Tracker`.
    2.  It iterates from `i = 0` to `i <= count`.
    3.  Inside the loop, it creates a new `Tracker` struct. The `Walks` field of this struct is set to `i - 2`.
    4.  The newly created `Tracker` struct is appended to the `result` slice.
    5.  Finally, the function returns the `result` slice containing the generated `Tracker` structs.

**Example:**

If `count` is 2, the function will return a slice containing the following `Tracker` structs:

*   `Tracker{Walks: -2}` (when i = 0)
*   `Tracker{Walks: -1}` (when i = 1)
*   `Tracker{Walks: 0}` (when i = 2)

**Summary:**

`pkg2` provides two functions, `GenTestWalks` and `GenTestWalksInverted`, to create slices of `Tracker` structs.  These functions appear to be designed for generating test data where the `Walks` field needs to follow a specific sequence (either increasing starting from 2 or increasing starting from -2). The `Naps` field (and any other fields in the `Tracker` struct) are left at their default zero values.
