## Shared Code Documentation: `pkg2` Package

This document describes the functionality provided by the `pkg2` package, located at `../test_src/pkg2/pk2.go`. This package relies on a struct definition in the `pkg1` package.

**Package Dependencies:**

*   `pkg1`:  This package, located at `../test_src/pkg1/pkg1.go`, defines the `Tracker` struct, which is used by the functions in `pkg2`.

**Functionality:**

The `pkg2` package provides two functions: `GenTestWalks` and `GenTestWalksInverted`. Both functions generate a slice of `pkg1.Tracker` structs, populating the `Walks` field with different values based on the input `count`. The `Naps` field of the `Tracker` struct is not explicitly set in these functions and will therefore default to its zero value (0).

**1. `GenTestWalks(count int) []pkg1.Tracker`**

*   **Purpose:** Generates a slice of `pkg1.Tracker` structs where the `Walks` field is incremented from 2 up to `count + 2`.

*   **Parameters:**
    *   `count int`: The number of `Tracker` structs to generate (plus one).  The returned slice will contain `count + 1` elements.

*   **Return Value:**
    *   `[]pkg1.Tracker`: A slice of `pkg1.Tracker` structs.  The i-th element in the slice will have its `Walks` field set to `i + 2`.  The `Naps` field will be set to 0.

*   **Example:**

    ```go
    result := GenTestWalks(2)
    // result will be:
    // []pkg1.Tracker{
    //  {Walks: 2, Naps: 0},
    //  {Walks: 3, Naps: 0},
    //  {Walks: 4, Naps: 0},
    // }
    ```

*   **Implementation Details:**

    The function initializes an empty slice of `pkg1.Tracker`. It then iterates from `i = 0` to `count` (inclusive). In each iteration, it appends a new `pkg1.Tracker` struct to the slice, setting the `Walks` field to `i + 2`.

**2. `GenTestWalksInverted(count int) []pkg1.Tracker`**

*   **Purpose:** Generates a slice of `pkg1.Tracker` structs where the `Walks` field is decremented from -2 up to `count - 2`.

*   **Parameters:**
    *   `count int`: The number of `Tracker` structs to generate (plus one).  The returned slice will contain `count + 1` elements.

*   **Return Value:**
    *   `[]pkg1.Tracker`: A slice of `pkg1.Tracker` structs.  The i-th element in the slice will have its `Walks` field set to `i - 2`.  The `Naps` field will be set to 0.

*   **Example:**

    ```go
    result := GenTestWalksInverted(2)
    // result will be:
    // []pkg1.Tracker{
    //  {Walks: -2, Naps: 0},
    //  {Walks: -1, Naps: 0},
    //  {Walks: 0, Naps: 0},
    // }
    ```

*   **Implementation Details:**

    The function initializes an empty slice of `pkg1.Tracker`. It then iterates from `i = 0` to `count` (inclusive). In each iteration, it appends a new `pkg1.Tracker` struct to the slice, setting the `Walks` field to `i - 2`.

**Summary:**

The `pkg2` package provides utility functions for generating slices of `pkg1.Tracker` structs with specific values for the `Walks` field. These functions are likely used for testing or simulation purposes.  The tests confirm that the expected output is properly generated for different input sizes.
